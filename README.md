# Null Island(s)

This repository contains GeoJSON files for four (4) versions of [Null Island](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Island):

* The original Null Island used in the GeoIQ Acetate basemap in 2010 ([source](https://github.com/geoiq/acetate-styles/tree/master/shp)) and the Stamen Toner and Terrain basemaps in 2011 ([source](https://github.com/stamen/toner-carto/tree/master/shp-local)).
* A 1-meter-square Null Island included in Natural Earth v1.3 in 2011 ([source](https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector/))
* A larger Null Island polygon created by [Nicholas Furness](https://github.com/nixta) in 2014 ([source](https://github.com/nixta/null-island))
* A 1-kilometer-square Null Island included in Natural Earth since v4.1 in 2018 ([source](https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector/)) 

And also, a [viewer](https://stamen.github.io/null-island) to compare all four.
